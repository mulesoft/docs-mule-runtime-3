|===
| Name  | Description
| xref:dw-math-functions-acos.adoc[acos] | Returns the arc cosine of a value; the returned angle is in the range 0.0 through pi. Special case:
- Argument absolute value is greater than 1, then the result is NaN.
| xref:dw-math-functions-asin.adoc[asin] | Returns the arc sine of a value; the returned angle is in the range -pi/2 through pi/2. Special cases:
- Argument absolute value is greater than 1, then the result is NaN.
| xref:dw-math-functions-atan.adoc[atan] | Returns the arc tangent of a value; the returned angle is in the range -pi/2 through pi/2.
| xref:dw-math-functions-cos.adoc[cos] | Returns the trigonometric cosine of an angle.
| xref:dw-math-functions-log10.adoc[log10] | Returns the base 10 logarithm of a double value
| xref:dw-math-functions-logn.adoc[logn] | Returns the natural logarithm (base e) of a double value. Special cases:
 - Argument less or equal to zero , then the result is NaN.
| xref:dw-math-functions-sin.adoc[sin] | Returns the trigonometric sine of an angle.
| xref:dw-math-functions-tan.adoc[tan] | Returns the trigonometric tangent of an angle.
| xref:dw-math-functions-todegrees.adoc[toDegrees] | Converts an angle measured in radians to an approximately equivalent angle measured in degrees.
| xref:dw-math-functions-toradians.adoc[toRadians] | Converts an angle measured in degrees to an approximately equivalent angle measured in radians
