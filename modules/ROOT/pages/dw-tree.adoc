= Tree (dw::util::Tree)

This utility module provides functions that enable you to handle values
as though they are tree data structures.

The module is included with Mule runtime. To use it, you must import it into
your DataWeave code, for example, by adding the line
`import * from dw::util::Tree` to the header of your script.

_Introduced in DataWeave 2.2.2. Supported by Mule 4.2.2 and later._

| Name  | Description
| xref:dw-tree-functions-asexpressionstring.adoc[asExpressionString] | Transforms a path to a string representation.
| xref:dw-tree-functions-filterarrayleafs.adoc[filterArrayLeafs] | This function filter only the Array Leaf values.
So the criteria is only going to be applied to Arrays values which values are
either `SimpleType` or `Null`
| xref:dw-tree-functions-filterobjectleafs.adoc[filterObjectLeafs] | This function filter only the Object Leaf values.
So the criteria is only going to be applied to Object values and Attributes which values are
either `SimpleType` or `Null`
| xref:dw-tree-functions-filtertree.adoc[filterTree] | Go through the nodes of the value and allows to filter them.
The `criteria` is going to be called with each value and its path.
If it returns true the node will remain if false it will be filtered.
| xref:dw-tree-functions-isarraytype.adoc[isArrayType] | Returns true if the provided path is an Array Type expression
| xref:dw-tree-functions-isattributetype.adoc[isAttributeType] | Returns true if the provided path is an Object Type expression
| xref:dw-tree-functions-isobjecttype.adoc[isObjectType] | Returns true if the provided path is an Object Type expression
| xref:dw-tree-functions-mapleafvalues.adoc[mapLeafValues] | Maps the terminal (leaf) nodes in the tree.
| xref:dw-tree-functions-nodeexists.adoc[nodeExists] | Returns `true` if any node in the tree validates against the specified criteria.
